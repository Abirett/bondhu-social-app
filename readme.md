<h1>Bondhu — Where Friends Get Connected</h1>
<p>
  Bondhu is a simple social media platform to connect people around the world
  🌎. This is actually a practice project, probably a silly clone version of
  Facebook. Main objective of this project is to get handy with a MVC framework
  and learn how to work with it. This knowlege will help me later to work with
  Laravel or any other PHP framework, that follows MVC pattern.

  <h2>Final Note - 2:56 AM, 30 May, 2023</h2>
  <p>
    Almost every basic functionalites implementation has been completed, except
    Some features like, Post Image Upload, Functional Settings Page, and a few
    little things.
    <br />
    Maybe Someday, I'll spend some time implement that feature later.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have been following Brad Traversy's Udemy course to build some kinda PHP
    MVC framework and build a project on that. Since the last week, I worked so
    hard and I was honestly dedicated to it. Now I'm kinda tired and bored to
    work with this project anymore. By the way, that was very first time in my
    life that I ever put some effort on project like this. It was really fun
    learning all these interesting things.
    <br />
    <strong>Thank You Dear Mentor, BRAD TRAVERSY 💚</strong>
